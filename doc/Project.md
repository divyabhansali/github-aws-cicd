# Project : Lambda - Dynamo DB -S3 Integration #
## Short description - In this project we have integrated lambda with dynamo DB database to insert and read data from the database.

## Concept : ##
- The Key concept of this projec is to make a telephonic directory and fetch and push the data based on user requirement.

-  For above functionality API is used for passing the user parameters for fetching or insering records, Lambda to interact with the API and Dynamo DB and Dynamo DB to store the details.

- One more functionality helps to maintain the integrity and authenticity of data by storing it in S3 bucket which is only accessible by Root User.
